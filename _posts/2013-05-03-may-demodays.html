    <p>
    This Saturday, ADI and Tech@NYU are co-hosting this final Spring DemoDay to bring everyone together for awesome collaboration and community!<br/>
    This is a great opportunity to see the creative results of folks from both ADI, NYU and the tech community at large, in the setting of a NYC startup!<br/>
    In case you're new around these parts, here's how it works: <br/>
<ul>
    <li>Students present dope projects: handful of 2-minute demos, a few 5-minute demos,</li>
    <li>Guest speakers from the NYC community rock the house 
    <ul>
        <li>John Ensor Parker from Nature of Energy</li>
        <li>Peter Bell from HackNY</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Eat pizza & hang out with us !</li>
</ul>
